When you initialize a repository, you create an empty git repository
that can be used to track your files.  You need to do it so that
you can start tracking your files.

the staging area allows you to specify what will go into the commit.
the working directory has a copy of all the  files.
This offers you more control over your commits.

Add only the files you need for your logical change to the 
staging area to ensure proper granularitet on commits.

branches can help when you want to have multiple versions
of the solution for whatever reason, testing etc

diagrams help visualize the structure by showing how the commits
relate to each other and which are connected.

the result of merging branches together is to incorporate
separate changes into the final solution. the diagram helps
us to visualize the change history.
