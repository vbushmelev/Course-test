Viewing FC diff showed the differences in the two files,
allowing to find the changes, and thus the bug.

Having the entire history of a file can make it easier
to change your mind, find bugs that were introduced
and revert to earlier versions if needed.

Manually making commits allows you to have restore
points that can be used as is.  It is prone to human error tho and 
there is the possibility to make commits too often or too rarely.

single documents created in google docs are probably not connected
with others in the same way that coding files are.  To deal
with coding projects, you need more advanced functionality.
Google docs is simpler if you don't need that complexity.

git log can be used to show what commits you have and some
information about them.  Git diff can show you more detailed
information about the changes that were made in the commits.

if you make a mistake, it will be easy to find it and revert
you can easily test out changes and return to previous
versions.

I want to use git for work and for developing android apps
at home.
